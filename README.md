# Projects
This repository is a compilation of my favorite projects I've worked on by myself or during school. It is for recruiters or interested career groups to see an example of my work and skills.


Game_3to14:
    Personal project to recrate electronically a family card game.
    Uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
    To run, open 3to14.html in a webbrowser.

InteractiveWorldMap:
    The InteractiveWorldMap is an Angular Application.
    Created a website application using Angular
    Created an interactive SVG world map which fetches API data for each country
    Angular routing, TypeScript, Angular component modules, and Angular services
    The folder is missing required App folders to run to allow for minimal data upload to repo. Missing folders include:
        .angluar
        .vscode
        node_modules
    To run, create a new Angular App and sustitute the InteractiveWorldMap src folder for the default src folder.

BearGridGame:
    My most involved developed game and also my most basic in terms of graphics or aesthetics.
    The player is an '@' symbol who plays with the goal of surviving the bears, the 'B' symbols.
    The player can create tools, collect resourses, build structures, and defend themselves against the bears with weapons.
    Developed completely in the C programming language in my first year learning Software Engineering.
    To run, execute .c file. I used Cygwin and the commands gcc Game_1.c, ./Game_1.exe

SudokuSolver:
    I engineered a robust C++ program capable of solving any Sudoku board by leveraging advanced backtracking algorithms.
    This code is also a demestration of using testing to validate results.
    To run, using Cygwin, compile with g++ Sudoku.hpp then run with ./Sudoku.exe
    The program will output the test results of the google test.
