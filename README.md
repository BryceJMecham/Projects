# Projects
This repository is a compilation of my favorite projects I've worked on by myself or during school. It is for recruiters or interested career groups to see an example of my work and skills.


Game_3to14:
    Personal project of a family card game.
    To run, open 3to14.html in a webbrowser.

InteractiveWorldMap:
    The InteractiveWorldMap is an Angular Application.
    The folder is missing required App folders to allow for minimal data upload to repo. Missing folders include:
        .angluar
        .vscode
        node_modules
    To run, create a new Angular App and sustitute the InteractiveWorldMap src folder for the default src folder.

StateInfoWebsite:
    To run, open index.html in a webbrowser.
